In the company internship period, I embarked on a journey to develop a robust and dynamic blog platform. Leveraging the power of Angular on the frontend and NestJS on the backend, I crafted a seamless user experience from start to finish. One of the pivotal aspects of this endeavor was implementing a comprehensive CRUD API and intuitive user interfaces for content management. However, the heart of this project lies in its focus on security and user authentication. I delved deep into the realm of authentication, ensuring that the blog not only delivers compelling content but also prioritizes the safety and privacy of its users. By incorporating cutting-edge authentication techniques, the blog guarantees a secure environment for both content creators and readers. Exploring the intersection of development, security, and user experience, this project stands as a testament to the seamless integration of frontend innovation and backend expertise.Feel free to clone the project from github link <strong>https://github.com/ibrahimjlidi/Projet</strong>
