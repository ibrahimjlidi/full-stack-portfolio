ITM-BC Project Experience

In my role as a Junior Developer at ITM-BC, I actively contributed to the development and testing of web applications, focusing extensively on WordPress-based solutions. Working remotely, I played a pivotal role in implementing robust WordPress applications, enhancing my expertise in this widely-used platform. My responsibilities included collaborating closely with seasoned developers, enabling me to gain valuable insights into complex technical challenges and refine my problem-solving skills.

Throughout this project, I utilized a range of essential tools including Jira for efficient project management, Trello for streamlined task organization, and GitHub for version control and collaborative coding. Additionally, I employed WordPress extensively, crafting intuitive and responsive user interfaces. Communication and collaboration were facilitated through platforms like Google Meet, allowing for seamless team interactions and knowledge sharing.

Active participation in brainstorming sessions and troubleshooting activities not only bolstered my technical skills but also provided me with a strong foundation in teamwork and collaborative problem resolution. This comprehensive experience has been pivotal in shaping my capabilities as a junior developer, equipping me with the skills necessary for challenging roles within the field of web development.
