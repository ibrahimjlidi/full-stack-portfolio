I spearheaded the development of a dynamic and user-friendly blog, employing Angular for the sleek and interactive front-end and Symfony for the robust back-end architecture. In this project, I meticulously crafted a comprehensive CRUD API, empowering users with the ability to seamlessly create, read, update, and delete content. Leveraging the power of Angular, I designed intuitive interfaces, ensuring an engaging user experience. With Symfony driving the back-end functionalities, the blog not only became a platform for creative expression but also a testament to the seamless fusion of cutting-edge technologies. This endeavor honed my skills in both front-end and back-end development, further solidifying my expertise in crafting efficient and intuitive web applications.Feel free to clone the project from github link <strong>https://github.com/ibrahimjlidi/Club</strong>
